        know you and that you are my brother. You are someone that I know I can rely on and have fun with. We’ve had some
        wonderful times disc golfing and traveling. I loved going to six flags with you every week. Our times watching movies
        every day was great too. There’s been so so many meaningful memories and I know there will be so many more. I want you
        to be there for me throughout my life. I can’t wait to continue to walk through life with you and go on more trips and
        make more memories.</h3>

        <h3>Hey Branson, I’m so lucky that I have a friend like you. We’ve gone through a lot together. Thank you for always being
        there for me. Ever since we were little we were putting effort to hang out. I loved friend Friday when you would come
        over and we would play video games. You taught me how to play Minecraft on the computer and that was the first real
        computer game I ever played. We’ve both helped each other through tough times and I know that we will always be best
        friends. You’ve definitely been there for me through hard times, thank you for being someone who is so honest and
        trustworthy. I am so thankful to at I have a friend who I can rely on and confide in. I can’t wait to walk through
        marriage with you by my side. You’ve also helped me to be successful while in high school and college. I wouldn’t have
        gotten half the jobs I’ve had if it hadn’t been for you.</h3>

        <h3>Hey Tyler, I am truly blessed to know a guy as unique and special as you. We grew close first through years of me waking
        you up every morning to play Minecraft on the computer. I bossed you around and apparently helped you through some
        difficult times even though I was pretty clueless that I was having any impact on you at all. You’ve invested so much
        into me emotionally and financially and I know that I won’t ever be able to repay you. Thank you for all that you’ve
        done for me. I love hanging out with you and doing crazy things. The hot tub nights have been a big part of my life,
        although they haven’t made me tan at all. I also love our Nashville trips, it’s so fun acting like kings in a foreign
        land while driving around in luxury cars that give you terrible back pain. You’ve also helped me through the worst times
        in my life. Thank you for always being there for me and for investing hours and hours and hours talking to me.</h3>

        <h3>Hey Boogs, where do I even begin. We’ve known each other for a long time. I’m sure that when you realized my personality
        you were horrified. I annoyed the crap out of you as a kid and probably as an adult also. There’s been so many great
        times. You introduced me to video games, maybe the worst thing that has ever happened to me but I loved it. I loved
        deleting all your progress because I couldn’t read. Thank you for investing me through the years. I have become a better
        man because of you and I love spending time with you. You have taught me how to be a hard worker and how to really think
        through problems before I just go and screw things up. I’ve loved traveling with you, the Boston trip was especially
        meaningful. You were there for me and watched over me. You really have taken me under your wing and helped guide me
        through school and life and I am truly thankful. I can’t wait to continue to walk through life and see how amazing of a
        father you will be.</h3>

        <h3>Hey Honey Bear, I am so grateful that I know you. You have been a role model for me and I know you will continue to be.
        We’ve had some amazing times.
        
        The first time I remember you really investing and in me was a hot summer day when I was probably 10. You came to me and
        gabby and asked if we wanted to go to the likes pool. You put us in the red jeep and took us there. I was so excited and
        it was awesome! You’ve invested so much into me and I can’t thank you enough. My favorite memory with you so far is
        probably building the casa. It was some hard work but it was so fun to learn and work while listening to Yanni. You’ve
        had a lot of patience for me throughout the years and I need it. I’m so glad that I’ve been able to help you through
        some difficult times, you’ve done the same for me. I know that there will be more times like that ahead but I’m so glad
        that I have people like you in my life that I can rely on and talk to about it. We’re stronger together.</h3>

        <h3>Hey uncle Bubba, you have made a big impact on my life. I have so many great memories with you. One good one was when we
        went to Philips house. We built a fireplace out of rocks and piled up wood on it, you got a sparkler and we tried to
        launch in at the fire, it didn’t work at all. We cheated and lit the fire anyway, then later there was a giant rock that
        exploded from the heat and launched right over your head into the lake, it was crazy! Thank you for investing so much
        into me. I love every time I get to spend time with you. The first time I tried the ice bath I thought I was gonna die
        but now it is a healthy obsession. I’ve loved going on the boat with you and laughing so hard when you crash while
        wakeboarding. I know that you will always be there for me. As I get ready to walk through this next chapter of my life,
        I am so thankful that I have you to rely on and to come to with questions and wisdom.</h3>

        <h3>Hey Nick, you’ve meant so much to me throughout my life. My first memory of you was when I went to visit your family in
        Boston. One night your Mom made meatloaf and you did not want it, you cried at the table for like 20 minutes because
        your Mom was making you eat it. You then got put in your room for another 20 minutes and then finally came out and took
        one bite. I was shocked, I just kept thinking, “Why don’t you just take a bite and get it over with?” We’ve had some
        awesome memories. As we’ve gotten older, we’ve grown closer. I love coming out and visiting you. I’m so excited to
        continue to grow closer to you and to walk through life with you.</h3>

        more board game nights where me and Corinne beat you (unless it’s trivia). I can’t wait to continue to grow closer to
